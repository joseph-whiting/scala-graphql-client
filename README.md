# scala-graphql-client
sbt plugin for typesafe consumption of GraphQL APIs in Scala

This is an attempt to make a way to consume GraphQL APIs easily and safely in Scala. The excellent Sangria library exists for the server side, but the use cases for this are in web/native Scala/ScalaJS frontends and backends that need to interface with GraphQL APIs.

I'm currently working on the basic framework of it and trying to get an end-to-end example going for a simple use case.

See [here](https://joseph-whiting.github.io/2018/04/10/Idea-For-A-Scala-GraphQL-Client-DSL-Code-Generator/) for the motivation and goals behind it
